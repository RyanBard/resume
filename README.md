# resume

A backup of various versions of my resume and the start of a back-end to store resume data.

The back-end was started in erlang, but is very unfinished due to complications with using the emongo driver (at the time, the latest emongo changes I was used to weren't available in a public repo yet).

One of these days, I'll probably continue to write the resume data back-end (probably in golang or maybe I'll just continue it in erlang, but use mnesia instead of mongodb).
